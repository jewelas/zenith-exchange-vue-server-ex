          comply with the international standards against money laundering or who may be regarded as
          political and public figures; we reserve the right to suspend or terminate a trade
          identified as suspicious based on our own assessment, which, however, does not breach any
          of our obligations and duties to you. Up to now, FuzionX has refused the trade or
